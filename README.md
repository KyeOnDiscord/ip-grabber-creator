Filename: The name of the exe when outputs <br>
Discord Webhook URL: Where you want the victim's IP to be received from, only valid urls are discord webhook, e.g: https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/748484003803168849/HSqsiM8uN5WvpMyWj4YbEQAQRkpsTT5aESKmPsKkT9yhlJ_SiFP3DLhYtkqO9nc3Yld9

Add Junk: Adds some empty classes & strings, etc so if some skiddy tries to decompile it they are intimidated or someshit like that ![](https://i.imgur.com/qEZfQJn.png)

Encode URL's with Base64 (Very Recommended): Makes the strings encoded in Base64 so when the victim tries to decompile it the Discord webhook url is encoded: ![](https://i.imgur.com/4DHTu15.png)

Obfuscate Exe: Makes pretty much the code unreadable and a clutterfuck with Calli Protection & some more string encryption. Credit to https://github.com/Sato-Isolated/MindLated for open source obfuscator! ![](https://i.imgur.com/69LPHyo.png)
