Filename: The name of the exe when outputs <br>
Discord Webhook URL: Where you want the victim's IP to be received from, only valid urls are discord webhook, e.g: https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/748484003803168849/HSqsiM8uN5WvpMyWj4YbEQAQRkpsTT5aESKmPsKkT9yhlJ_SiFP3DLhYtkqO9nc3Yld9

Add Junk: Adds some empty classes & strings, etc so if some skiddy tries to decompile it they are intimidated or someshit like that. Also makes it take a fuckload of time to decompile. <br>
